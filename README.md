Dedicated iOS Developer proficient in Swift + SwiftUI development. Ambassador of being a Swiftie without ever listening to Taylor Swift. 

I started my Swift developer journey with an independent project â€” an iPhone app called Stable. I developed, tested and shipped this application to the AppStore. During the process, I:
<br />â€” Built a responsive UI with advanced animations using SwiftUI.
<br />â€” Utilised a REST API and several SDKs, including Snapkit SDK and Google AdMob SDK.
<br />â€” Successfully conducted external testing of several builds using App Store Connect and TestFlight.


About the project:

"stable." is your place to concentrate on your mental health, wellbeing and productivity.
